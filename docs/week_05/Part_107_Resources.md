# Part 107 Resources

A curated set of study resources for the FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot test, organized by resource type with brief descriptions and reasons to visit.

## Official FAA
- [FAA Part 107 (regulations)](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/part_107/) — The official Part 107 rule text, summaries, and related guidance. Visit for authoritative regulatory language, official interpretations, and to verify compliance requirements.
- [LAANC (airspace authorization)](https://www.faa.gov/uas/research_development/airspace_integration/laanc) — FAA overview of the LAANC program, provider list, and interactive maps showing approved altitudes. Visit to learn how to obtain near‑real‑time controlled‑airspace authorizations and to plan operations near airports.
- [FAA DroneZone (authorizations/registration)](https://faadronezone.faa.gov/) — FAA portal for sUAS registration, account management, and waiver/authorization submissions. Visit to practice the administrative steps required after certification and to understand waiver workflows.

## Study guides and explanations
- [Part 107 Study Guide — J. Rupprecht](https://jrupprechtlaw.com/part-107-test-study-guide/) — Structured, topic‑by‑topic explanations of Part 107 concepts (definitions, operating limitations, waivers, airspace classes, chart reading). Visit to build a clear conceptual framework, resolve ambiguous rule language, and follow a study roadmap tied to exam topics.

## Practice questions and visual scenarios
- [72 Practice Questions — J. Rupprecht](https://jrupprechtlaw.com/part-107-knowledge-test/) — A bank of multiple‑choice questions with answers and short explanations covering common Part 107 subjects. Visit to assess readiness, practice pacing, and identify weak topics to focus study.
- [Visual Practice Questions — J. Rupprecht](https://jrupprechtlaw.com/part-107-test-questions-remote-pilot-knowledge-test/) — Image‑ and chart‑based questions mirroring exam visual items; includes annotated examples and reading guidance. Visit to improve sectional/chart interpretation and confidence with visual exam items.

## Weather, NOTAMs, and airspace status
- [AviationWeather.gov (METAR/TAF and weather tools)](https://www.aviationweather.gov/) — Centralized aviation weather products (METARs, TAFs, SIGMETs, graphical forecasts, wind/ceiling tools). Visit to practice decoding METAR/TAF, evaluate weather risk for sUAS flights, and learn which products are relevant for planning.
- [FAA NOTAMs / TFRs](https://notams.aim.faa.gov/notamSearch/) — Searchable NOTAM and Temporary Flight Restriction data with map views and filters. Visit as a mandatory pre‑flight check to discover temporary or local restrictions that could affect legal or safe operations.

## Tools and portals
- [LAANC provider pages (via FAA LAANC link)](https://www.faa.gov/uas/research_development/airspace_integration/laanc) — Links to LAANC providers and maps showing authorization altitudes and constraints. Visit to choose a provider or to see how provider interfaces present authorization windows.
- [FAA DroneZone (authorizations/registration)](https://faadronezone.faa.gov/) — (Also listed under Official FAA) Use for actual registrations, waiver submissions, and account status checks.

## Video playlists and review strategy

A curated set of video playlists and standalone review videos for the FAA Part 107 exam, organized by type with concise summaries and recommended use. Use these alongside the study guides, practice questions, FAA pages, and weather/NOTAM tools listed above.

### Full\-length comprehensive reviews
- [FREE Part 107 Study Guide — Matt Kendall (1h36m)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB9qzXaQ72s) — A single, end\-to\-end walkthrough covering regulations, charts, weather (METAR/TAF), performance, emergency procedures, and sample questions. Useful as a full read\-through or final cram. Timestamps: intro/exam structure, regs (~5:00), charts (~20:00), authorizations (~35:00), weather (~50:00), performance (~1:10:00), emergencies (~1:20:00), practice Qs (~1:28:00). Recommendation: watch once to map the domain and mark weak areas; use timestamps to revisit specific topics.

### Concise slide/overview videos
- [FREE Drone Pilot FAA Part 107 Study Guide (short slides)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO1CXPsCKoQ) — A compact slide‑based review of core topics (exam format, regs, airspace, METAR basics, performance, decision frameworks). Use early to get a quick roadmap or immediately before the exam as a rapid refresher.

### Topic\-focused playlists (short videos / quick refreshers)
- Short playlist (quick topic videos) — `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGspbs93n4nP5g4SFPOJswZ21Qv3ynl1K`  
  Summary: Short, focused clips that target single concepts (airspace classes, chart symbols, METAR snippets). Good for rapid refresh sessions, micro\-learning, or reviewing one weakness in 10–15 minutes.

### Topic\-focused playlists (longer / deeper videos)
- FAA Part 107 Exam Study Guides playlist — `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRd2JSjVHovGabIuGeoupZgkzGmdys4Ol`  
  Summary: Longer, in‑depth videos and multi‑part lessons on individual domains (airspace, weather theory, sectional practice). Many contain worked examples and on‑screen chart decoding. Use for a deep dive on persistent weak topics.

### Practice test and walkthrough videos
- King Schools free online practice tests — `https://free-faa-exam.kingschools.com/drone-pilot/gradetest`  
  Summary: Timed practice exams and question banks. Use for simulated testing under time pressure and to validate readiness after video study.

### How to integrate videos with the rest of your resources
1. Initial pass: watch the concise slide video (`GO1CXPsCKoQ`) to get a roadmap of topics and exam format.  
2. Full review: watch the Matt Kendall full review (`zB9qzXaQ72s`) once to build a complete mental map; note timestamps for weak areas.  
3. Targeted drills: use the short playlist (`PLGspb...`) for quick refreshers and the longer playlist (`PLRd2JS...`) for in‑depth lessons on problem domains you marked. Pause videos and solve practice problems yourself before watching answers.  
4. Practice questions: alternate between Rupprecht practice banks (links above) and King Schools timed tests to simulate exam pacing and identify persistent errors. Track topic categories of missed questions.  
5. Authoritative cross‑check: when rules or interpretations are unclear, refer to the official FAA Part 107 page and FAA guidance (listed in the Official FAA section) to confirm exact regulatory language.  
6. Real‑world procedure practice: use `FAA DroneZone` and `LAANC` pages to understand registration, waiver, and airspace authorization workflows (practice the administrative steps you will need after certification).  
7. Weather and NOTAM practice: decode real METAR/TAF data on `AviationWeather.gov` and search active NOTAMs/TFRs via the FAA NOTAM page; treat these as mandatory pre‑flight checks you should be able to perform quickly.  
8. Final prep: create a timestamped cheat sheet of timestamps + key facts from the full review and slide videos so you can jump back to a 5–10 minute refresher per topic the day before the exam. Finish with 1–2 timed practice tests (King Schools + Rupprecht) and a final quick slide review.

### Quick viewing tips
- Actively pause and attempt problems (METAR decoding, chart interpretation) before revealing answers.  
- Keep a short scratch sheet of rules, airspace altitudes, and METAR abbreviations while watching.  
- Use video descriptions and pinned comments for downloadable extras (PDFs, practice sheets) many creators include.
