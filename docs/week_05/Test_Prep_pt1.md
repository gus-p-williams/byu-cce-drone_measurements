# Test Prep Part 1 — FAA Part 107 (Remote Pilot) Overview

This file contains concise study notes covering common Part 107 topics: regulations, airspace, sectional charts, weather sources, CRM/ADM, and radio communications. Use these for quick review and short practice questions.

---

## Regulations (Part 107) — Key Points
- Remote pilot certificate required for commercial sUAS operations.
- Operational limits:
  - Visual line-of-sight (VLOS) required (able to see the aircraft unaided).
  - Maximum altitude: 400 ft AGL (unless within 400 ft of a structure).
  - Maximum groundspeed: 100 mph (87 knots).
  - Daylight-only operations (or civil twilight with appropriate anti-collision lighting).
  - Minimum visibility: 3 statute miles; remain clear of clouds (500 ft below, 2,000 ft horizontal).
- Operations in controlled airspace (Classes B, C, D, and E) require ATC authorization (LAANC or manual).
- Waivers available for certain restrictions (night ops, beyond visual line of sight, etc.).
- Right-of-way: give way to manned aircraft; avoid creating hazards.

---

## Airspace (Classification, Operating, and Restrictions)
- Class A: 18,000 ft MSL and above — not applicable to Part 107 operations.
- Class B: Surrounds busiest airports (surface to varying ceilings). ATC permission required.
- Class C: Surrounds medium traffic airports (core and shelf). ATC permission required.
- Class D: Surrounds airports with control towers (typically surface to 2,500 ft AGL). ATC permission required.
- Class E: Controlled airspace not A/B/C/D; some starts at surface (sfc E) — ATC authorization required if operating within controlled surface area; otherwise uncontrolled portions behave like Class G for sUAS without ATC.
- Class G: Uncontrolled; sUAS operations allowed without ATC authorization (still subject to Part 107).
- Special use airspace: Restricted, Prohibited, Warning, Military Operations Areas (MOAs), Alert areas — observe restrictions and obtain permission where required.
- Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) — always avoid; check NOTAMs.

Quick rule: For B/C/D/E (controlled) get ATC authorization; G is generally open.

## Sectional Charts — What to Read Quickly
- Airport symbols: towered vs non‑towered, fuel services, lighting.
- Airspace depiction:
  - Class B: solid blue lines with altitude numbers (e.g., "30" = floor/shelf in hundreds of feet MSL).
  - Class C: solid magenta lines.
  - Class D: dashed blue line.
  - Class E surface area: dashed magenta.
- Special use areas: R (restricted), P (prohibited), MOA, WARNING/ALERT areas shown with labels.
- Obstacles and elevations: highest elevation figure vs terrain contours.
- VFR checkpoints, reporting points, and prominent landmarks for navigation.
- Chart supplement/airport facility directory: frequencies, traffic patterns, remarks.

---

## Weather Sources (Reports)
- METAR: current surface aviation weather observation — key elements: wind, visibility, clouds, temperature/dew point, altimeter, remarks.
- TAF: Terminal Aerodrome Forecast — forecasted conditions for specific airports.
- AIRMET / SIGMET: inflight weather advisories for hazardous conditions (icing, turbulence, mountain obscuration, convective SIGMET).
- PIREP / UA: pilot reports of actual conditions.
- Aviation weather tools:
  - AviationWeather.gov
  - FAA NOTAM search / TFRs
  - Flight Service briefings: 1-800-WX-BRIEF (or online)
  - METAR/TAF apps and XM/ADS-B weather (if available)
- Density altitude, wind, and gusts are critical for small UAS performance and safe operations.

---

## CRM / ADM (Crew Resource Management / Aeronautical Decision Making)
- Apply ADM to single‑pilot sUAS operations:
  - IMSAFE checklist: Illness, Medication, Stress, Alcohol, Fatigue, Emotion/Eating.
  - PAVE checklist: Pilot, Aircraft, enVironment, External pressures.
  - Identify hazards, assess risk, mitigate (go/no-go decision).
- Task and workload management: prioritize communications, prebrief emergency procedures.
- Communication with stakeholders (spotters, observers, client, ATC) — establish roles and hand signals.
- Preflight brief: weather, airspace, lost link procedures, contingency landing sites.

---

## Radio / Communications
- Use standard phraseology; be concise and professional.
- Common frequencies:
  - CTAF/UNICOM: self-announced traffic at non-towered airports.
  - Tower/Approach/Departure: controlled airports — contact only with permission where required.
- Readbacks: read back clearances and critical instructions.
- Phonetic alphabet for clarity (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, ...).
- Light gun signals at towered airports (if no radio) — know meaning.
- Obtain ATC authorization through LAANC or FAA DroneZone when required; follow any altitude/time limitations issued.

---

## Quick Mnemonics / Reminders
- IMSAFE (personal fitness)
- PAVE (risk checklist)
- "See and avoid" — always lookout, yield to manned aircraft.
- Max altitude = 400 ft AGL (unless waivered / near structure).
- Min visibility = 3 SM; cloud clearance: 500 ft below, 2,000 ft horizontal.

---

## Short Practice Questions
1. What is the maximum altitude allowed for sUAS operations without a waiver?  
2. Which airspace requires ATC authorization before Part 107 operations?  
3. What does a METAR report provide?  
4. What mnemonic helps assess personal fitness to fly?  
5. How far horizontally must you remain from clouds during Part 107 operations?

Answers:
1. 400 ft AGL.  
2. Classes B, C, D, and E (controlled airspace) — ATC authorization required.  
3. Current surface aviation weather observation (wind, visibility, clouds, temp/dew, altimeter).  
4. IMSAFE.  
5. 2,000 ft horizontal.

## Study Tips
- Practice sectional chart identification and airspace boundaries visually.
- Review METAR/TAF formats until you can pick key elements quickly.
- Walk through preflight and emergency briefings out loud.
- Use practice question sets regularly and review explanations for missed items.
