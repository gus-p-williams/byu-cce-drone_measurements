## I. What is FAA Part 107?

### A. Regulatory Background

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) governs all civil aviation in the United States, including small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS). The primary regulation for commercial drone operations is **14 CFR Part 107**, formally titled the "Small Unmanned Aircraft Rule."

**14 CFR Part 107** was enacted on **August 29, 2016**, and established a regulatory framework that allows commercial drone operations without requiring a traditional pilot's license. Before Part 107, commercial drone operators needed a manned aircraft pilot certificate and a Section 333 exemption — a slow and expensive process.

**Purpose of Part 107:**

- Provide a clear, accessible path for commercial sUAS operations
- Establish safety standards for drone flights in the National Airspace System (NAS)
- Define pilot certification, operating rules, and aircraft requirements for drones under 55 lbs

### Recreational vs. Part 107 vs. Public COA

It is important to understand when Part 107 applies versus other regulatory paths:

| | **Section 44809 (Recreational)** | **Part 107 (Commercial)** | **Public COA (Government)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Who** | Hobbyists flying for fun | Anyone flying for work, business, or compensation | Federal, state, and local government agencies |
| **Certificate** | TRUST completion (free online test) | Remote Pilot Certificate (FAA knowledge test) | Certificate of Authorization or Part 107 |
| **Key Rules** | Community-based guidelines, VLOS, under 55 lbs | Part 107 operating rules (detailed below) | Agency-specific; may have broader authority |
| **Compensation** | Not allowed | Allowed | Government operations |

**When is Part 107 required?** Any time you fly a drone for commercial purposes — including real estate photography, construction surveying, agricultural inspection, mapping, or any operation where you receive compensation or the flight furthers a business interest. If you are a civil engineering student using drones for project work or research, Part 107 applies.

## II. Eligibility & Certification Process

### A. Eligibility Requirements

To obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate under Part 107, you must:

- Be at least **16 years old**
- Be able to read, speak, write, and understand **English**
- Be in a **physical and mental condition** to safely operate a small UAS
- Pass the **initial aeronautical knowledge test** (UAG — Unmanned Aircraft General)
- Pass a **TSA security background check**

There is no flight experience or flight hours requirement. You do not need a medical certificate (unlike manned aircraft pilot certificates). However, you must self-assess your fitness to fly before each operation.

### B. Steps to Certification

The certification process involves several steps, typically completed over a few weeks:

**Step 1 — Create an IACRA Account**
Register at the FAA's Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA) system at [iacra.faa.gov](https://iacra.faa.gov). You will receive a **FAA Tracking Number (FTN)**, which you need to schedule your exam.

**Step 2 — Study and Prepare**
Review study materials covering the exam knowledge areas (see Section III below). Use FAA study guides, practice question banks, and the resources listed at the end of this document.

**Step 3 — Schedule the Exam**
Register for the "Unmanned Aircraft General – Small (UAG)" knowledge test through a PSI testing center. Tests are available at PSI locations nationwide. The exam costs approximately **$175**.

**Step 4 — Take the UAG Knowledge Test**
The exam is administered at the testing center on a computer. You have 120 minutes to answer 60 multiple-choice questions. You need a score of **70% (42 correct)** to pass.

**Step 5 — Complete IACRA Application**
After passing, log back into IACRA and submit your application for a Remote Pilot Certificate (14 CFR Part 107).

**Step 6 — TSA Security Vetting**
The TSA conducts a background security check. This typically takes a few days to a few weeks.

**Step 7 — Receive Temporary Certificate**
Once TSA vetting is complete, you can download a temporary certificate from IACRA. This is valid immediately and allows you to operate commercially.

**Step 8 — Receive Permanent Certificate**
Your permanent Remote Pilot Certificate card is mailed to you, typically within several weeks.

![Figure 4 — Part 107 Certification Process](images/fig04_certification_process.svg)
*Figure 4: Step-by-step certification process from IACRA registration through permanent certificate.*

### C. Recurrent Training Requirements

Your Remote Pilot Certificate does not expire, but you must maintain **currency** to exercise its privileges. Every **24 months**, you must either:

- Complete the **FAA recurrent online training** (free, at [faasafety.gov](https://www.faasafety.gov)), or
- Retake the UAG knowledge test at a PSI testing center

If you let your currency lapse, you cannot legally operate under Part 107 until you complete recurrent training. There is no penalty for lapsing — just complete the training before your next flight.

## IV. Airspace Fundamentals (Core Exam Topic)

Airspace is the single most heavily tested topic on the Part 107 exam. You must understand the National Airspace System classification, know which airspace types require ATC authorization, and be able to identify airspace boundaries on a sectional chart.

### A. National Airspace System (NAS)

The NAS divides airspace into six classes:

![Figure 11 — Airspace Classification](images/fig11_airspace_classes.svg)
*Figure 11: Vertical profile of the National Airspace System showing all airspace classes. Note the Part 107 400 ft AGL limit at the bottom.*

| Class | Type | Altitude | ATC Auth. for sUAS? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | Controlled | 18,000 ft MSL – FL600 | N/A | IFR only. No Part 107 ops. |
| **B** | Controlled | Surface – varies | **Yes** | Busiest airports (e.g., SLC, ATL). "Inverted wedding cake" shape. |
| **C** | Controlled | Surface – typically 4,000 ft AGL | **Yes** | Medium-traffic airports. Core + shelf. |
| **D** | Controlled | Surface – typically 2,500 ft AGL | **Yes** | Towered airports. |
| **E** | Controlled | Varies (700 ft, 1,200 ft, or surface) | **Yes** (if surface area) | Most airspace above 1,200 ft AGL. |
| **G** | **Uncontrolled** | Surface – varies | **No** | Default airspace. Most sUAS ops happen here. |

**Key rule:** You need ATC authorization (via LAANC or FAA DroneZone) to fly in **any controlled airspace** (B, C, D, and surface E). Class G is uncontrolled — no ATC authorization needed, but all Part 107 rules still apply.

### B. Sectional Charts

Sectional charts are the standard visual flight rules (VFR) aeronautical charts. On the Part 107 exam, you will be asked to interpret them. Key features to identify:

- **Class B airspace**: Solid **blue** lines with altitude figures (e.g., "100/40" means ceiling 10,000 ft MSL, floor 4,000 ft MSL)
- **Class C airspace**: Solid **magenta** lines
- **Class D airspace**: Dashed **blue** lines
- **Class E surface area**: Dashed **magenta** lines
- **Airport symbols**: Blue for towered, magenta for non-towered
- **Obstructions**: Marked with tower symbols showing MSL and AGL heights
- **Special-use airspace**: Restricted (R), Prohibited (P), MOAs, Warning areas

Practice reading the sectional chart legend and identifying these features before the exam. The FAA testing supplement provides the chart excerpts you will use during the test.

### C. LAANC Authorization

**Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC)** is an automated system that provides near-real-time airspace authorization for Part 107 operators in controlled airspace. Through LAANC-approved apps (such as Aloft, AirMap, or DJI FlySafe), you can:

- Request authorization to fly in controlled airspace
- Receive approval in seconds (for altitudes at or below the published LAANC ceiling grid)
- See the maximum altitudes approved for specific grid cells near airports

If you need to fly above the LAANC ceiling grid, you must submit a manual authorization request through the FAA DroneZone portal, which can take up to 90 days.

## V. Operating Rules Under Part 107

### A. Key Operational Limitations

Part 107 establishes the following operating rules for sUAS:

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Maximum altitude** | 400 ft above ground level (AGL) |
| **Structure exception** | May fly above 400 ft if within 400 ft of a structure (and not higher than 400 ft above the structure's top) |
| **Visual line of sight** | PIC must maintain unaided VLOS with the sUAS at all times |
| **Time of day** | Daylight or civil twilight (with anti-collision lighting visible for 3 statute miles) |
| **Maximum speed** | 100 mph (87 knots) groundspeed |
| **Minimum visibility** | 3 statute miles from the control station |
| **Cloud clearance** | 500 ft below clouds, 2,000 ft horizontally from clouds |
| **Right of way** | Must yield to all manned aircraft |
| **People** | Do not fly over non-participating persons (unless they are under cover or inside a vehicle) |
| **Moving vehicles** | Do not fly over moving vehicles on public roads (unless briefly transiting) |
| **Multiple aircraft** | One pilot, one drone at a time (unless waiver obtained) |
| **Aircraft weight** | Under 55 lbs (including payload) at takeoff |

![Figure 13 — Visual Line of Sight Requirement](images/fig13_vlos.svg)
*Figure 13: The remote PIC must maintain direct visual contact with the sUAS at all times. A Visual Observer may assist but does not replace the PIC's VLOS obligation.*

![Figure 14 — 400 ft AGL Altitude Rule](images/fig14_400ft_agl.svg)
*Figure 14: In open areas, the maximum altitude is 400 ft AGL. Near a structure, you may fly up to 400 ft above the structure's top, provided you remain within 400 ft horizontally of the structure.*

### B. Waivers

The FAA may grant **waivers** for certain Part 107 restrictions if the applicant demonstrates the operation can be conducted safely. Waiver applications are submitted through the FAA DroneZone.

**Waiverable provisions include:**

| Waiverable | Not Waiverable |
|---|---|
| Operations at night (107.29) | Registration requirement |
| Operations over people (107.39) | Hazardous materials |
| Operations beyond VLOS (107.31) | Yielding right of way to manned aircraft |
| Multiple aircraft operations (107.35) | Airworthiness of the sUAS |
| Operations from a moving vehicle (107.25) | Remote PIC certification |
| Altitude above 400 ft (107.51) | ATC authorization in controlled airspace |
| Minimum visibility / cloud clearance (107.51) | Operating in a careless or reckless manner |

*Figure 15: Table of waiverable vs. non-waiverable Part 107 provisions. Note that waivers for BVLOS and over-people operations require substantial safety documentation.*

!!! warning "Important"
    A waiver does not guarantee approval. You must submit a detailed safety case explaining how you will mitigate risks. Waiver processing typically takes 90 days or more.

## VI. Weather & Aviation Weather Services

Weather is a critical factor in sUAS operations. Wind, visibility, cloud ceiling, and temperature all affect flight safety and aircraft performance. The Part 107 exam tests your ability to interpret aviation weather products.

### A. Basic Weather Theory

**Key concepts:**

- **Atmospheric stability**: Stable air resists vertical motion (smooth flying conditions, fog/stratus possible). Unstable air promotes vertical motion (turbulence, cumulus clouds, thunderstorms).
- **Lapse rate**: Temperature decreases approximately 2C per 1,000 ft in standard atmosphere. When the actual lapse rate exceeds the standard rate, the atmosphere is unstable.
- **Dew point**: The temperature at which air becomes saturated and moisture condenses. When temperature and dew point converge (spread < 4F), expect fog or low clouds.
- **Fog formation**: Radiation fog forms on clear, calm nights. Advection fog forms when warm, moist air moves over a cold surface. Both can reduce visibility to zero.
- **Convection**: Heating of the surface causes thermals and turbulence. Strong convection produces cumulonimbus clouds (thunderstorms) — a serious hazard to all aircraft.

### B. METARs and TAFs

**METAR** (Meteorological Terminal Aviation Routine Weather Report) provides current observed conditions at an airport. You will be expected to decode METARs on the exam.

**Sample METAR with labeled components:**

```
METAR KSLC 121756Z 17010KT 10SM FEW080 SCT150 BKN250 27/06 A3012 RMK AO2
```

| Component | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `METAR` | Report type (routine observation) |
| `KSLC` | Station identifier (Salt Lake City International) |
| `121756Z` | Date/time: 12th day, 17:56 UTC (Zulu) |
| `17010KT` | Wind from 170 at 10 knots |
| `10SM` | Visibility: 10 statute miles |
| `FEW080` | Few clouds at 8,000 ft AGL |
| `SCT150` | Scattered clouds at 15,000 ft AGL |
| `BKN250` | Broken clouds at 25,000 ft AGL |
| `27/06` | Temperature 27C / Dew point 6C |
| `A3012` | Altimeter setting: 30.12 inHg |
| `RMK AO2` | Remarks: automated station with precipitation sensor |

*Figure 16: Annotated METAR example. Practice decoding METARs until you can identify key elements quickly.*

**TAF** (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast) provides a forecast of conditions at an airport, typically covering a 24- to 30-hour period. TAFs use similar encoding to METARs but include change groups (FM, TEMPO, BECMG, PROB) indicating expected condition changes over time.

**Other weather products to know:**

- **AIRMET** — Advisories for moderate icing, turbulence, sustained surface winds > 30 kt, mountain obscuration, and IFR conditions
- **SIGMET** — Significant meteorological information for severe conditions (severe icing, severe turbulence, volcanic ash)
- **Convective SIGMET** — Thunderstorm-related warnings
- **PIREPs (UA)** — Pilot reports of actual conditions (turbulence, icing, cloud tops)

!!! tip "Study Tip"
    The best way to learn METAR/TAF decoding is practice. Visit [AviationWeather.gov](https://www.aviationweather.gov) and decode several real METARs for airports in your area.

## VII. Loading, Performance & sUAS Limitations

### A. Aircraft Performance Factors

Even though sUAS are much lighter than manned aircraft, the same physics applies. Understanding performance factors helps you operate safely.

**Density Altitude**

Density altitude is the altitude at which the aircraft "thinks" it is flying based on air density. High density altitude means thinner air and reduced performance.

Density altitude increases with:

- **Higher temperature** — hot air is less dense
- **Higher elevation** — less air above means less pressure
- **Higher humidity** — moist air is less dense than dry air
- **Lower barometric pressure** — less molecular density

*Figure 19: At high density altitudes (hot, high, humid conditions), your sUAS will have reduced thrust, shorter battery life, and decreased maneuverability. Always account for these conditions in your flight planning.*

**Practical impacts on sUAS:**

- Reduced motor thrust and lift capacity
- Shorter hover time and flight duration
- Increased battery consumption
- Longer takeoff and climb times

**Weight and Balance / Center of Gravity (CG)**

The center of gravity is the point where the aircraft balances. For sUAS:

- Adding payload (camera, sensor, delivery package) shifts the CG
- A CG outside the acceptable range causes instability, difficulty hovering, or loss of control
- Always verify your total takeoff weight is under 55 lbs
- Secure all payloads to prevent shifting during flight

*Figure 20: The CG must remain within the manufacturer's specified envelope. Adding a heavy sensor package to one side of the drone without counterbalancing can cause control problems.*

**Temperature Effects on Batteries**

- **Cold temperatures** reduce battery voltage and capacity — expect shorter flight times in winter
- **Hot temperatures** can cause batteries to overheat, leading to thermal cutoffs or swelling
- Store and transport batteries at room temperature
- Warm batteries to at least 60F (15C) before flight in cold conditions

## VIII. Aeronautical Decision-Making & Safety

Good decision-making is as important as technical knowledge. The FAA emphasizes Aeronautical Decision-Making (ADM) and Crew Resource Management (CRM) as core competencies for remote pilots.

### A. Risk Management

**PAVE Checklist**

PAVE is a structured framework for pre-flight risk assessment. Before every flight, evaluate each element:

![Figure 22 — PAVE Risk Assessment](images/fig22_pave.svg)
*Figure 22: The PAVE checklist systematically evaluates four risk categories before flight.*

- **P — Pilot**: Am I physically and mentally fit? Current and proficient?
- **A — Aircraft**: Is the sUAS airworthy? Batteries charged? Props inspected?
- **V — enVironment**: What is the weather? Airspace? Terrain? Obstacles? NOTAMs?
- **E — External Pressures**: Is there schedule pressure? Client demands? "Get-there-itis"?

If any element raises concern, mitigate the risk or make a no-go decision.

**IMSAFE Checklist**

IMSAFE is a personal fitness self-assessment:

![Figure 23 — IMSAFE Checklist](images/fig23_imsafe.svg)
*Figure 23: The IMSAFE checklist for self-assessing personal fitness to fly.*

- **I** — Illness: Am I sick?
- **M** — Medication: Am I taking anything that impairs judgment?
- **S** — Stress: Am I under unusual psychological pressure?
- **A** — Alcohol: Have I consumed alcohol in the last 8 hours? Am I below 0.04% BAC?
- **F** — Fatigue: Am I adequately rested?
- **E** — Emotion/Eating: Am I emotionally upset? Hungry or dehydrated?

If the answer to any IMSAFE question is "yes" (or "no" for rest/eating), seriously consider postponing the flight.

### B. Crew Resource Management (CRM)

CRM applies to sUAS operations even with a single pilot. Key principles:

**Communication:**

- Brief all crew members (visual observers, ground crew, client) before the flight
- Establish clear roles: who monitors airspace, who watches for people/obstacles, who communicates with ATC
- Use standard terminology and hand signals
- Debrief after the flight to capture lessons learned

**Task Delegation:**

- Do not overload yourself — use visual observers to help scan for traffic
- Assign a dedicated person to monitor the flight app / telemetry
- If you are overwhelmed, land the aircraft and reassess

**Hazardous Attitudes:**

The FAA identifies five hazardous attitudes that lead to poor decisions:

| Hazardous Attitude | Example | Antidote |
|---|---|---|
| **Anti-authority** | "Rules don't apply to me" | "Follow the rules — they exist for a reason" |
| **Impulsivity** | "Do something — quick!" | "Not so fast — think first" |
| **Invulnerability** | "It won't happen to me" | "It could happen to me" |
| **Macho** | "I can handle it" | "Taking chances is foolish" |
| **Resignation** | "What's the use?" | "I'm not helpless — I can make a difference" |

*Figure 24: Recognize these attitudes in yourself and apply the antidotes before making flight decisions.*

---

## IX. Maintaining Currency & Responsibilities

### A. Recurrent Training

Your Remote Pilot Certificate is permanent, but you must maintain **currency** to legally exercise its privileges:

- Complete **recurrent training every 24 months** from the date of your initial test or last recurrent completion
- Recurrent training is available **free online** at [FAASafety.gov](https://www.faasafety.gov) (look for the Part 107 Recurrent Training course)
- Alternatively, you may retake the UAG knowledge test at a PSI center
- You do NOT need to retake the full knowledge test if you complete the online training

| Timeline Event | Action Required |
|---|---|
| Month 0 | Pass initial UAG knowledge test |
| Month 24 | Complete recurrent training or retake test |
| Month 48 | Complete recurrent training or retake test |
| Every 24 months thereafter | Repeat |

*Figure 25: Currency is maintained on a rolling 24-month cycle. Mark your calendar.*

### B. Recordkeeping & Reporting

**Accident Reporting Requirements**

Under 14 CFR 107.9, the remote PIC must report to the FAA within **10 days** if an sUAS operation results in:

- **Serious injury** to any person (requiring hospitalization, surgery, or resulting in death)
- **Loss of consciousness** of any person
- **Property damage** (other than to the sUAS) exceeding **$500**

Reports are filed through the **FAA DroneZone** portal.

![Figure 26 — Accident Reporting Decision Tree](images/fig26_accident_reporting.svg)
*Figure 26: Use this decision tree to determine whether an incident requires FAA reporting.*

!!! warning "Key Point"
    Damage to your own drone does NOT trigger reporting — only damage to other people's property exceeding $500, or injury/loss of consciousness of any person.

**Remote ID Requirements**

As of March 16, 2024, all drones operating under Part 107 must comply with **Remote ID** requirements:

- **Standard Remote ID**: The sUAS broadcasts identification and location data via radio frequency
- **Remote ID Broadcast Module**: An add-on device that broadcasts identification data for drones that lack built-in Remote ID
- **FAA-Recognized Identification Areas (FRIAs)**: Designated areas where drones without Remote ID may operate (being phased out)

Remote ID allows law enforcement and other airspace participants to identify and locate drones in flight. Ensure your sUAS is Remote ID compliant before every operation.

*Figure 27: Remote ID broadcasts the drone's serial number, location, altitude, velocity, and control station location in real time.*

### C. Registration

All sUAS weighing more than **0.55 lbs (250 grams)** and less than 55 lbs must be **registered with the FAA** through [FAA DroneZone](https://faadronezone.faa.gov). Registration:

- Costs $5 for Part 107 (per aircraft)
- Is valid for 3 years
- Requires the registration number to be displayed on the aircraft
