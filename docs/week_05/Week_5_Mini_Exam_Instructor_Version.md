## Instructor Notes

This mini-exam focuses on:

- Recognizing controlled vs. uncontrolled airspace
- Understanding Class B, C, D, and E depictions
- Interpreting shading and dashed boundaries
- Connecting chart interpretation to Part 107 operating rules

Encourage students to physically point to symbols on Figure 10 while answering.

# Questions with Detailed Explanations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 1

The airport depicted in Figure 10 with a blue runway symbol indicates:

- (A) A non‑towered airport
- (B) A towered airport
- (C) A military airport
- (D) A closed airport

**Correct Answer: B --- A towered airport**

**Explanation:**
On sectional charts, **blue airport symbols indicate towered airports**.
Magenta symbols indicate non‑towered airports.
This distinction is heavily tested on the FAA exam.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 2

The dashed blue circle surrounding an airport indicates:

- (A) Class C airspace
- (B) Class B airspace
- (C) Class D airspace
- (D) Class E airspace

**Correct Answer: C --- Class D airspace**

**Explanation:**
A **blue dashed circle** represents Class D airspace, typically
extending from the surface to 2,500 feet AGL (unless otherwise noted).
Part 107 pilots must obtain **ATC authorization (LAANC)** to operate
inside it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 3

A shaded magenta area indicates:

- (A) Class D airspace
- (B) Class E beginning at 700 feet AGL
- (C) Restricted airspace
- (D) Prohibited airspace

**Correct Answer: B --- Class E beginning at 700 feet AGL**

**Explanation:**
Shaded magenta means Class E starts at **700 feet AGL**.
Below 700 feet AGL is typically Class G unless otherwise designated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 4

If Class E begins at 700 feet AGL in the area shown, what airspace
exists at 400 feet AGL?

- (A) Class E
- (B) Class D
- (C) Class G
- (D) Class B

**Correct Answer: C --- Class G**

**Explanation:**
From the surface up to 699 feet AGL, the airspace is **Class G**.
Since 400 feet AGL is below 700 feet AGL, the operation would be in
Class G.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 5

A restricted area labeled with an "R" indicates:

- (A) Flight is always prohibited
- (B) Flight is permitted without authorization
- (C) Flight is restricted when the area is active
- (D) Only recreational pilots are restricted

**Correct Answer: C --- Flight is restricted when active**

**Explanation:**
Restricted areas contain unusual, often hazardous activity.
They may be flown through only when **not active and with proper
authorization**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 6

If operating inside the dashed blue circle at 300 feet AGL under Part
107, you must:

- (A) Notify the airport manager only
- (B) Obtain ATC authorization (LAANC)
- (C) File a flight plan
- (D) Remain below 200 feet AGL

**Correct Answer: B --- Obtain ATC authorization**

**Explanation:**
Class D airspace requires prior ATC authorization under Part 107,
regardless of altitude (even at 50 ft AGL).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 7

A flag symbol next to an airport indicates:

- (A) The airport has a rotating beacon
- (B) The airport has weather reporting capability
- (C) The airport is private
- (D) The airport is military

**Correct Answer: B --- Weather reporting capability**

**Explanation:**
A flag symbol indicates **AWOS/ASOS weather reporting services** are
available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 8

Solid blue concentric rings around an airport indicate:

- (A) Class C airspace
- (B) Class B airspace
- (C) Class D airspace
- (D) Class E airspace

**Correct Answer: B --- Class B airspace**

**Explanation:**
Class B airspace is depicted as **solid blue concentric rings** and
surrounds the nation's busiest airports.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 9

If Class E airspace begins at 1,200 feet AGL, how is it depicted?

- (A) Shaded magenta
- (B) Shaded blue
- (C) Dashed magenta
- (D) Solid blue

**Correct Answer: B --- Shaded blue**

**Explanation:**
Shaded blue indicates Class E beginning at **1,200 feet AGL**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 10

If you plan to fly at 350 feet AGL inside controlled airspace shown in
Figure 10, you must:

- (A) Obtain a waiver
- (B) Obtain ATC authorization
- (C) Contact the TSA
- (D) Remain clear of clouds only

**Correct Answer: B --- Obtain ATC authorization**

**Explanation:**
All controlled airspace (Class B, C, D, and E to the surface) requires
authorization before operating under Part 107.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 11

Magenta airport symbols indicate:

- (A) Towered airports
- (B) Military airports
- (C) Non‑towered airports
- (D) Closed airports

**Correct Answer: C --- Non‑towered airports**

**Explanation:**
Magenta runway symbols represent airports without an operating control
tower.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 12

If no shading or dashed lines appear at your launch location, what
airspace is most likely present at the surface?

- (A) Class B
- (B) Class C
- (C) Class D
- (D) Class G

**Correct Answer: D --- Class G**

**Explanation:**
Absent shading or dashed boundaries, surface airspace is generally Class
G.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 13

The top number in a fractional airspace label (e.g., 100/40)
represents:

- (A) The floor in hundreds of feet AGL
- (B) The ceiling in hundreds of feet MSL
- (C) Visibility requirements
- (D) Cloud clearance requirements

**Correct Answer: B --- The ceiling in hundreds of feet MSL**

**Explanation:**
In sectional fractional notation:
Top number = ceiling (MSL)
Bottom number = floor (MSL)

Example: 100/40
Ceiling = 10,000 ft MSL
Floor = 4,000 ft MSL

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 14

Under Part 107, maximum altitude is:

- (A) 400 feet MSL
- (B) 400 feet AGL (unless within 400 ft of a structure)
- (C) 700 feet AGL
- (D) 1,200 feet AGL

**Correct Answer: B --- 400 feet AGL**

**Explanation:**
Maximum altitude is 400 ft AGL,
OR within 400 ft of a structure and not more than 400 ft above that
structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 15

If a prohibited area (P‑###) appears in Figure 10, you may:

- (A) Fly with ATC authorization
- (B) Fly below 200 feet
- (C) Not operate inside it without specific authorization
- (D) Fly if under 55 pounds

**Correct Answer: C --- Not operate inside it without specific
authorization**

**Explanation:**
Prohibited areas are **completely off-limits** unless specific
authorization is granted.
These are often established for national security or safety reasons.

# Teaching Tip

After grading, review:

- Blue vs. magenta differences
- Shaded vs. dashed meanings
- Controlled vs. uncontrolled airspace

These three concepts alone account for a large percentage of missed FAA
questions.
