# Class Overview and Structure

## Introduction

Welcome to the drone class.

You will be accessing your before class readings and videos on GitHub throughout the semester. 
These resources will be separated into two categories: PreClass Readings and Other Resources.
You will have to read/watch all content under the PreClass Readings to receive full credit on your reading quizzes.
The Other Resources are resources meant to be helpful to you while working on your assignment for the class.


# Day 1 — Introduction to Drones for Measurement in Civil Engineering

Welcome to **Drone Measurements**. This course is built around a core principle of civil engineering:  
**measurement matters, but the required accuracy depends on the decision being made**.

Sometimes a simple method — such as pacing a distance or taking a single photograph — is accurate enough.  
Other times, engineering decisions require carefully planned data collection and processing, producing
orthomosaics or 3D models accurate to the centimeter or better.

Drones allow engineers to operate across this entire spectrum. Throughout this course, you will learn
how to select appropriate measurement methods, understand their limitations, and evaluate whether the
data quality is sufficient for engineering use.

## Why Use Drones for Measurement?

Drones expand what civil engineers can measure safely, efficiently, and repeatedly. Compared to
traditional field methods, drones can:

- Collect data quickly over large or difficult-to-access areas
- Improve safety by keeping personnel out of hazardous environments
- Provide consistent, repeatable measurements over time
- Capture spatial data that integrates directly with CAD, GIS, and modeling software

However, drone data is **not automatically accurate**. Flight planning, sensor choice, ground control,
and processing decisions all affect the quality of the final measurements. This course emphasizes
*understanding those tradeoffs*.

## Visual Measurements: Photos and Orthomosaics

### Aerial Photos

The most basic drone measurement product is an aerial photograph. When the camera position, altitude,
and lens properties are known, distances and areas can be estimated directly from images.

Aerial photos are commonly used for:

- Site reconnaissance
- Visual documentation
- Identifying features and boundaries
- Preliminary measurements when high precision is not required

Even simple photos can provide valuable engineering insight when used appropriately.

---

### Orthomosaics

An **orthomosaic** is created by stitching many overlapping images into a single, geometrically corrected
map with a uniform scale. Unlike raw photos, orthomosaics allow accurate measurement anywhere in the image.

Orthomosaics are used for:

- Measuring distances and areas
- Mapping construction sites
- Creating base maps for design and planning
- Comparing site conditions over time

With proper planning and ground control, orthomosaics can achieve centimeter-level accuracy.

## Terrain and Surface Models

### Digital Elevation Models (DEM)

A **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)** represents the elevation of the surface, including vegetation,
structures, and terrain. DEMs are useful for:

- Drainage analysis
- Surface modeling
- Change detection

---

### Digital Terrain Models (DTM)

A **Digital Terrain Model (DTM)** represents the bare earth surface, with vegetation and structures removed.
DTMs are commonly used for:

- Earthwork calculations
- Grading design
- Hydrologic modeling
- Infrastructure planning

Both DEMs and DTMs can be generated from drone imagery or LiDAR data.

## Volumetric Measurements

One of the most common engineering uses of drones is **volume estimation**. By creating 3D surface models,
engineers can calculate volumes of:

- Stockpiles
- Excavations
- Embankments
- Material removal or placement over time

Volume calculations depend heavily on data quality and surface visibility, making them an excellent
example of how measurement accuracy directly affects engineering decisions.

## Specialized Sensors and Measurement Types

Drones can carry sensors beyond standard RGB cameras, enabling additional types of measurement:

- **Thermal cameras** for detecting heat differences in structures, pavements, and utilities
- **Multispectral sensors** for vegetation health, erosion monitoring, and environmental analysis
- **LiDAR sensors** for high-accuracy 3D point clouds, especially in vegetated or complex terrain

Each sensor provides different information and comes with its own accuracy, cost, and processing
considerations.

## Measurement Tradeoffs in Engineering Practice

Civil engineers must constantly balance:

- Accuracy
- Time
- Cost
- Safety

Not every task requires survey-grade precision, and not every problem can be solved with a simple
measurement. Drones provide flexible tools that support both rapid assessments and high-accuracy
engineering analyses — when used correctly.

## Course Focus

In this course, you will learn:

- How drone-based measurements are collected
- How different data products are created
- What limits accuracy and reliability
- How to decide whether a dataset is *good enough* for engineering use

Today’s introduction sets the foundation for the rest of the course. In the coming weeks, you will
gain hands-on experience planning flights, collecting data, and evaluating measurement quality.
