# Class Overview and Structure

## Introduction

Welcome to the drone class.

You will be accessing your before class readings and videos on GitHub throughout the semester. 
These resources will be separated into two categories: PreClass Readings and Other Resources.
You will have to read/watch all content under the PreClass Readings to receive full credit on your reading quizzes.
The Other Resources are resources meant to be helpful to you while working on your assignment for the class.
