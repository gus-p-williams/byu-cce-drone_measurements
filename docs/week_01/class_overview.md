# Class Overview and Structure

## Introduction

Welcome to the drone class.

You will be accessing your before class readings and videos on GitHub throughout the semester. 
These resources will be separated into two categories: PreClass Readings and Other Resources.
You will have to read/watch all content under the PreClass Readings to receive full credit on your reading quizzes.
The Other Resources are resources meant to be helpful to you while working on your assignment for the class.


# Day 1 — Introduction to Drones for Measurement in Civil Engineering

Welcome to **Drone Measurements**. This course is grounded in a fundamental principle of civil engineering:
**engineering decisions are only as good as the measurements that support them**.

Civil engineers routinely operate under constraints of accuracy, time, cost, safety, and available
technology. In some situations, approximate measurements — such as pacing distances or visual
estimates — are sufficient to inform decisions. In other cases, engineering judgment requires
high-quality, well-documented data, such as orthomosaics or 3D models with centimeter-level accuracy.

This course introduces drone-based measurement methods as tools that support engineering analysis,
design, and decision-making. Emphasis is placed not only on data collection, but on evaluating whether
the collected data are **appropriate, reliable, and defensible** for a given engineering application.

## Engineering Use of Drones for Measurement

Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), commonly referred to as drones, have become valuable tools in civil
engineering practice. When properly applied, drones enable engineers to:

- Collect spatial data efficiently over large or complex sites
- Improve safety by reducing exposure to hazardous environments
- Acquire repeatable measurements to support monitoring and change detection
- Integrate spatial data into engineering analysis, modeling, and design workflows

However, drone data quality depends on engineering decisions made during planning, flight execution,
and data processing. Understanding these dependencies is essential to responsible engineering practice.

## Visual Measurements: Photos and Orthomosaics

### Aerial Photographs

Aerial photographs represent the simplest form of drone-based measurement. When camera properties,
flight altitude, and geometry are understood, distances and areas can be estimated directly from images.

Aerial photographs are commonly used for:

- Preliminary site reconnaissance
- Visual documentation of existing conditions
- Identifying features relevant to engineering analysis
- Approximate measurements when high precision is not required

Engineers must recognize the limitations of photographic measurements and assess whether their accuracy
is sufficient for the intended application.

---

### Orthomosaics

An **orthomosaic** is produced by processing multiple overlapping images into a single geometrically
corrected image with a uniform scale. Orthomosaics allow consistent measurement across the entire image
and reduce distortions present in individual photographs.

Orthomosaics support engineering tasks such as:

- Measuring distances and areas
- Mapping construction sites and infrastructure
- Creating base maps for design and planning
- Documenting site conditions over time

With appropriate flight planning and ground control, orthomosaics can achieve centimeter-level accuracy,
making them suitable for many civil engineering applications.

## Terrain and Surface Modeling

### Digital Elevation Models (DEM)

A **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)** represents the elevation of the surface, including terrain,
vegetation, and structures. DEMs are commonly used in civil engineering for:

- Drainage and watershed analysis
- Surface modeling
- Change detection and monitoring

---

### Digital Terrain Models (DTM)

A **Digital Terrain Model (DTM)** represents the bare-earth surface, with vegetation and structures
removed. DTMs are essential for engineering analyses that require an accurate representation of ground
surface geometry, including:

- Earthwork and grading design
- Cut-and-fill calculations
- Hydrologic and hydraulic modeling

Both DEMs and DTMs may be generated using photogrammetry or LiDAR, each with distinct advantages and
limitations.

## Volumetric Measurements

Drone-derived 3D models are widely used for **volumetric measurement** in civil engineering practice.
These methods enable engineers to estimate volumes of:

- Stockpiles
- Excavations
- Embankments
- Material placement or removal over time

Accurate volume estimation requires careful attention to data resolution, surface visibility, and
processing methods. Engineers must evaluate uncertainty and understand how measurement errors affect
project decisions.

---

## Specialized Sensors and Advanced Measurement Methods

Drones can carry specialized sensors that extend measurement capabilities beyond standard imagery:

- **Thermal sensors** for detecting temperature differences in pavements, structures, and utilities
- **Multispectral sensors** for environmental assessment, vegetation analysis, and erosion monitoring
- **LiDAR sensors** for high-resolution 3D point clouds, particularly in vegetated or complex terrain

Each sensor type introduces tradeoffs in accuracy, cost, data volume, and processing complexity.
Selecting the appropriate sensor requires engineering judgment and an understanding of project
requirements.

---

## Measurement Accuracy, Uncertainty, and Engineering Judgment

Civil engineers must balance multiple constraints when selecting measurement methods, including:

- Required accuracy and precision
- Time and cost limitations
- Safety considerations
- Data processing and documentation requirements

Not all engineering problems require the same level of measurement accuracy. A key objective of this
course is developing the ability to assess **when data are sufficient** and **when higher-quality
measurements are justified**.

## Course Emphasis and Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Apply drone-based measurement techniques to civil engineering problems
- Evaluate the accuracy and limitations of different measurement methods
- Integrate drone-derived data into engineering analysis and design workflows
- Make informed, ethical, and defensible engineering decisions based on measured data

Today’s introduction establishes the measurement-focused framework that will guide the remainder of
the course. Subsequent lessons will build practical skills in flight planning, data collection, data
processing, and quality assessment.
