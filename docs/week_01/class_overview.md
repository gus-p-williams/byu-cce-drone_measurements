# Welcome to Drone Measurements

![Students flying on campus](images/w01_overview_photo_placeholder.svg){ width="100%" }

You will fly a drone in the first lab of this class. By the end of the semester you will be able to
put one over a construction site, turn what it saw into a map, measure something off that map, and
defend the number when a client asks where it came from.

That last part is what makes this an engineering course rather than a flying course.

!!! abstract "Key Takeaways"
    - **A drone is a measuring instrument.** It happens to fly. What matters is the data it brings
      back.
    - **Accuracy is something you buy.** More of it costs more time, money, and effort. Deciding how
      much you actually need is part of the job.
    - **You have to be able to defend the number.** Anyone can produce a measurement. An engineer
      can explain why it is good enough for the decision being made.

## What you'll do this semester

![The six weeks of the course](images/w01_overview_semester.svg){ width="100%" }

*Six weeks, one hour each. Every week builds on the one before it.*

Each week is a short lecture followed by something you actually do: a flight, a lab, or a piece of
software. The [flight checklists](../flight_check_list/index.md) and
[Flight Basics](flight_basics.md) are there whenever you need them.

## Before you fly: the TRUST certificate

Anyone flying a drone recreationally in the United States has to pass **TRUST**, The Recreational
UAS Safety Test. You need yours before the first lab, and you will not be allowed to fly without it.

It is not an exam in any meaningful sense. It is a short set of questions with a bit of reading
attached, and it is designed so that everyone passes.

| | |
|---|---|
| Cost | Free |
| Where | Online, through any FAA-approved administrator |
| How long | About 30 minutes |
| Can you fail it? | No. Miss a question and it shows you the answer, then asks again |
| Does it expire? | No |
| Do you carry it? | Yes, whenever you fly |

It covers the basics you would want any pilot near you to know: where you may and may not fly,
staying below 400 feet, keeping the aircraft in sight, giving way to crewed aircraft, and when a
drone has to be registered.

!!! warning "Save your certificate when you finish"
    The FAA does not keep a copy. The certificate is issued to you once, and if you lose it your
    only option is to take the test again. Download the PDF, then email it to yourself.

    [Take the TRUST test](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_flyers/knowledge_test_updates){target="_blank"}

TRUST covers the flying you do in this class. **Part 107** is the separate certificate you need to
fly for work, and [Week 5](../week_05/FAA_Exam_Planning_and_Overview.md) is devoted to earning it.

## Why engineers care

Every project has a budget and a deadline. A measurement ten times more accurate than the decision
requires is wasted money. One that is not accurate enough is worse than useless, because it still
looks like an answer.

![Accuracy against time, cost and effort](images/w01_overview_accuracy_effort.svg){ width="100%" }

*A drone sits between a tape measure and a survey crew: it covers a whole site quickly and gets
close to survey accuracy.*

Drones did not replace any of the older methods. They filled a gap nothing else covered well, which
is large areas, quickly, at an accuracy good enough for most civil work. That is why they turned up
on construction sites so fast.

## What you get from a flight

A drone flight produces photographs. Software turns those photographs into things you can measure.

![From photos to a measurement](images/w01_overview_products.svg){ width="100%" }

*The same set of photos becomes a map, then a surface, then a number you can put in a report.*

![Surface model compared with terrain model](images/w01_overview_surface_vs_terrain.svg){ width="100%" }

*Whether you keep the trees and buildings or strip them out depends entirely on the question you
are answering.*

!!! question "Activity: The Right Tool for the Job"
    As an engineer, you must decide how much accuracy you actually need. Match the following scenarios to the most appropriate measurement method:

    **Scenarios:**
    1.  **Site Reconnaissance:** You need to see if a remote 100-acre field has large boulders or trees before sending a crew.
    2.  **Structural Monitoring:** You are checking if a bridge support beam has settled by more than 5 millimeters in the last year.
    3.  **Earthwork Volume:** You need to estimate the volume of a 50-foot tall dirt stockpile for a weekly billing report.

    **Methods:**
    - **A. Manual/Approximate:** Pacing or simple aerial photos.
    - **B. High-Precision Drone Survey:** Orthomosaic and 3D reconstruction with ground control points.
    - **C. Specialized Survey:** High-order GPS or total station.

    *Think about it:* Why would using a high-precision drone survey for Scenario #1 be a waste of resources? Why would Scenario #2 require even more than a standard drone?

## What you need

- **Your TRUST certificate**, before the first lab. See
  [above](#before-you-fly-the-trust-certificate). This one is not optional.
- **Nothing to buy.** Aircraft, controllers, and batteries are provided.
- **A laptop** that can run QGIS, which is free.
- **Closed-toe shoes and a jacket.** Some of this class happens outside.
- **No prior experience.** Most students arrive having never flown anything.

??? note "Course learning objectives"
    By the end of this course, students will be able to:

    - Apply drone-based measurement techniques to civil engineering problems
    - Evaluate the accuracy and limitations of different measurement methods
    - Integrate drone-derived data into engineering analysis and design workflows
    - Make informed, ethical, and defensible engineering decisions based on measured data

Next up: [Flight Basics](flight_basics.md), which covers the aircraft, the controller, and how to
get it into the air and back again.
