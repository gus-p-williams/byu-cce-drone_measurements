# Metadata for Aerial Measurements

## What is Metadata?

In the simplest terms, **metadata** is "data about data." 

Think of a can of soup in your pantry. 
*   The **data** is the soup inside the can (the actual content you want).
*   The **metadata** is the label on the outside: the ingredients, nutritional facts, expiration date, and manufacturer. 

Without the label (metadata), you wouldn't know if the soup is tomato or chicken noodle, or if it expired three years ago. The soup exists, but it's hard to use safely or effectively.

## Why Metadata Matters for Drones

When we fly drones to take measurements or photos, the images themselves are our **data**. However, a photo of a construction site or a cornfield isn't very useful on its own if we don't know the context.

For aerial measurements, the most critical metadata includes:

1.  **Location (Geospatial Data):** 
    *   **Latitude and Longitude:** Exactly where on Earth was the drone when it took the picture?
    *   **Altitude:** How high above the ground was it? (This affects the scale of the image—how big things look).
2.  **Time (Temporal Data):** 
    *   **Timestamp:** When was the image captured? This is crucial for tracking changes over time (e.g., "How much did the construction site progress between Monday and Friday?").
3.  **Orientation:**
    *   **Heading (Yaw):** Which direction was the drone facing? (North, South, East, West?)
    *   **Gimbal Pitch:** Was the camera looking straight down (nadir) or at an angle (oblique)?

## EXIF Data

Most digital cameras, including those on drones, automatically save this metadata inside the image file itself. This format is called **EXIF** (Exchangeable Image File Format).

If you take a photo with a drone and open the file properties on your computer, you can often see this hidden information. It tells software (like photogrammetry tools) exactly how to stitch the photos together to create a 3D model or a map.

## Summary

*   **Data** = The image or measurement itself.
*   **Metadata** = The "who, what, when, where, and how" of that data.

Always ensure your drone's settings are correct (especially the clock and GPS connection) so your metadata is accurate. Bad metadata can make good data useless!
